To add your JUG to this list just PR a new markdown document under the _jugs directory

The file must have specific metadata at the start

```
---
name:
location:
homepage:
---
details info about your jug in markdown
```

And thats it.

For an example have a look at the files [here](https://github.com/spoole167/jugs/_jugs)
